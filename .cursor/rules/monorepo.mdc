This is a TypeScript monorepo. It consists in one Next.js app inside apps/web. You are only allow to edit the 
Next.js app in apps/web, the ui package in packages/ui, and the contracts package in package/contract.

If you need to add a shadcn component that is not already in packages/ui, you must first navigate to apps/web,
and then use the shadcn cli command from there:

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [COMPONENT]
```
