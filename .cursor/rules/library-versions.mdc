When installing libraries, do not rely on your own training data.

Your training data has a cut-off date. You're probably not aware of all of the latest developments in the JavaScript and TypeScript world.

This means that instead of picking a version manually (via updating the package.json file), you should use a script to install the latest version of a library.

You always have to `cd` first into the app or project where you need the library.

Example:

# pnpm

```
cd apps/web && pnpm add -D @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

This will ensure you're always using the latest version.
